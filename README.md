# ferment_incubator

## Overview

With just a Cool Box, Ceramic Heater, temperature and humidity Sensor and a Arduino UNO, an incubator can be easily assembled.   
Here comes an accessible way of fermenting food at home, with a menu to choose among some ferments by default and an option to set your own time and temperature up.

## How to do it

See [documentation](https://github.com/f3rcode/ferment_incubator/wiki) for more details.

## Installation

From Arduino IDE.
*It requires aditional libraries whose links are in the documentation*

## Usage

Once every module is set up and connected, you only need to switch the Arduino on and interact with the menu on screen to start fermenting.
